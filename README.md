This project demonstrates an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline using the Titanic dataset.
The pipeline handles preprocessing of numerical and categorical features using ColumnTransformer and trains a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated.
The final pipeline model is saved as a .pkl file for deployment use.
